### Data description

Sequence data is available at DDBJ under the accession DRA000540.

There were 3 experiments under DRA000540 (DRX001415 is the first sequencing run; DRX001413 and DRX001414 are the second sequencing run):

1. DRX001413 (RIKEN ID SRhi10024) - Illumina HiSeq 2000 of the uncut samples (pLKO, shDicer and shDrosha) from the less than 200 nt small RNA fraction
2. DRX001414 (RIKEN ID SRhi10025) – Illumina HiSeq 2000 of the cut samples (pLKO, shDicer and shDrosha) from the less than 200 nt small RNA fraction
3. DRX001415 (RIKEN ID U29-DA) – Illumina GAIIx of the 3 samples, mock (Isce-I library), uncut (NIH 2/4 library) and cut (NIH 2/4 Isce-I library)
